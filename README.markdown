# BVB scoring board

This project contains the source code for the [interactive scoring board][board]
that keeps track of the matches of the German soccer team **BV Borussia Dortmund
09**.


## Components

The project consists of the REST backend powered by *php* and *mysql* and the
frontend that is written in *javascript*.

The frontend would not be possible without:

* [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [jquery](http://jquery.com/)
* [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/)
* [flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/) (yet to come)
